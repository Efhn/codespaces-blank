# Variables and Expressions

We learned about the following concepts:
- integers
- floats
- strings
- how to capture and convert user input

## Integers

Use the 'int()' to convert a string or float to an integer to a float number

## Floats 

use the 'float()' to convert a string or integer to a float number 

## Input

You can cast the user input to a different variable type in one line of code. for example:

```python 
# Take user input and convert it to an integer 
age = int(input('What is your age? '))
```
## Strings

Use the `str()` function to convert numbers to strings.
If you need to bring the new line character, use `\n` . 
If you need to print special characters, use the `\` character. You want to "escape" the character


For raw strings use`r'<string>'`. This wil take the strings as is. No need to escape any characters.
## Markdown notes

- Use \# for Title level 1 
- Use \#\# for Title level 2
- Use two spaces to create a new line
- Use backtick `` to highlight special words
- Use triple ticks for code intrpretation 

## Git Notes
- To track new files you need to `add` or `stage` the files
- To commit a version, use the `commit` command. A comment
