# Variables and Expressions

We learned about the following concepts:
- integers
- floats
- strings
- how to capture and convert user input

## Integers

Use the 'int()' to convert a string or float to an integer to a float number

## Floats 

use the 'float()' to convert a string or integer to a float number 

## Input

You can cast the user input to a different variable type in one line of code. for example:

```python 
# Take user input and convert it to an integer 
age = int(input('What is your age? '))
```
